# Analysis-repository

It is my first project with real world data as well as it is my first time uploading it publicly.

To set up the whole project, you should folow the link: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey
There you can find "Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey 2022" and line "Download Full Data Set (CSV)" and download it.

After that you should open project file, find "Data_set" folder and insert downloaded archive. Unzip it inside and you are almost done.

Then you have to make sure that bigger ".csv" file has this name "survey_results_public.csv".
Optionaly name second .csv file "survey_results_schema.csv"

The only way to open project is using PyCharm.
